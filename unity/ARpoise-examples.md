# ARpoise -Mobile- App - Examples

## Overview
**ARpoise** is a location based AR app, once you download, install and start it on your device it will use your
device's GPS coordinates and send a request to the **ARpoise** back end to see whether there are specific art works
shown at you location. If there are specific artworks at your location, you will see them. If not, a default layer will
be shown to you. We will change that layer periodically.
## Setting Device Fixed Location
In order to give you the possibility to look at more examples, we have placed some layers
at the example location one degree north and one degree east.
The **ARpoise** app allows do set a fixed device location, if you do so, the device will not use the real GPS coordinates
but will send the coordinates you entered to the **ARpoise** back end.

In order to use this feature, you will have to

- start **ARpoise** and let the default layer load, Evolution of Fish in my case


- double tab on the **ARpoise** logo in the upper left corner of the screen
