# ARpoise -Mobile- App - Examples

## Overview
**ARpoise**, [see arpoise.com](https://arpoise.com), is a location based AR app, once you download, install and start it on your device, it will use your
device's GPS coordinates and send a request to the **ARpoise** back end to see whether there are specific art works
shown at you location. If there are specific artworks at your location, you will see them. If not, a default layer will
be shown to you. We will change this default layer periodically.
## Setting Device Fixed Location
In order to give you the possibility to look at more examples, we have placed some layers
at the example location one degree north and one degree east.
The **ARpoise** app allows to set a fixed device location, if you do so, the device will not use the real GPS coordinates
but will send the coordinates you entered to the **ARpoise** back end.

In order to use this feature, you will have to

- Start **ARpoise** and let the default layer load, 'Evolution of Fish' in my case, your screen should look like:

- Double tab on the **ARpoise** logo in the upper left corner of the screen, the input panel should appear, enter 1 for latitude and 1 for longitude and then check the 'Active Fixed Position' check box, your screen should look like:

- Tab on OK, a list of layers available at GPS location one degree north and one degree east should appear, your screen should look like:

- Tab on any of the layers offered, the layer will be loaded and shown, 'Reign of Gold' in my case, your screen should look like:

- If you tab again on the **ARpoise** logo in the upper left corner of the screen, the list of layers appears again.

- Note: Once you are done, don't forget to double tab and open the input panel once more and uncheck the 'Active Fixed Position' check box, so you can use **ARpoise** with real GPS coordinates once more!

- The input panel can of course be used to enter the coordinates of any location in the world. So if you know that a specific layer is currently shown at XYZ museum, just enter the GPS coordinates of that museum's location and see what the visitors see at the museum.
