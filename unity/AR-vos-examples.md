# AR-vos Augmented Reality App: Examples

## Overview


The [**ARpoise** (**A**ugmented **R**eality **p**oint **o**f **i**nterest **s**ervice **e**nvironment)](http://arpoise.com/) is an open-source Augmented Reality platform. It was developed by [Peter Graf](http://mission-base.com/peter/) and [Tamiko Thiel](http://tamikothiel.com/) in 2018 to provide an open source AR platform that they could keep alive as the underlying technology changes. Since Tamiko began creating AR artworks in 2010, she has used multiple commercial AR platforms that all have gone out of business. She and Peter created ARpoise to provide a long-term alternative that can evolve with the technology. They will keep the platform alive as long as they live, and with the entry of the work [Unexpected Growth](http://tamikothiel.com/unexpectedgrowth/) into the Whitney Museum of American Art collection, they have a top-rank museum partner also dedicated to preserving the platform.

**AR-vos** is a location and image trigger based AR app, once you download, install and start it on your device, it will use your
device's GPS coordinates and send a request to the **ARpoise** back end to see whether there are specific art works
shown at you location. If there are specific artworks at your location, you will see them. If not, a default layer will
be shown to you. We will change this default layer periodically.

## Example Image Triggers
The layer 'Tamiko Thiel's AR' is currently the default layer.

In order to see the triggered objects, you have to

- Start **AR-vos** and let the default layer load, your screen should look like:
