# AR-vos -Mobile- App - Examples

## Overview
**AR-vos** is a location and image trigger based AR app, once you download, install and start it on your device, it will use your
device's GPS coordinates and send a request to the **ARpoise** back end to see whether there are specific art works
shown at you location. If there are specific artworks at your location, you will see them. If not, a default layer will
be shown to you. We will change this default layer periodically.
