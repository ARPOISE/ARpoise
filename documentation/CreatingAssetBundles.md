This will take a while, afterwards you can end the Build Settings view.

## Folders
In the Project panel right click on **Assets** and select **Create / Folder** from the context menu. Create the folders **AssetBundles**, **Editor**, **Materials**, and **Prefabs**.

## 3D Assets
Sorry, this is not a Unity tutorial for creating 3D assets.
For the tutorial two game objects are created in the SampleScene, a red cube and a blue sphere.

## 3D Prefabs
Turn the two objects into prefabs by dragging them from the **SampleScene** panel to the **Prefabs** folder created above.

### Image - Prefabs:

Make sure both prefabs do not have any transformations, e.g.:

## CreateAssetBundles Script
Right click on the **Editor** folder, from the context menu select **Create / C# Script**.
Call the script **CreateAssetBundles**. Repeat the step and call the second script **CreateiOSAssetBundles**.

Double click on the **CreateAssetBundles** script. Visual Studio or your favorite C# editor should open.

Empty the file and copy the following lines into the file and save it.
```
using System.IO;
using UnityEditor;

public class CreateAssetBundles
{
    [MenuItem("Assets/Build AssetBundles")]
    static void BuildAllAssetBundles()
    {
        string assetBundleDirectory = "Assets/AssetBundles";
        if (!Directory.Exists(assetBundleDirectory))
        {
            Directory.CreateDirectory(assetBundleDirectory);
        }
        BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles(assetBundleDirectory, BuildAssetBundleOptions.None, BuildTarget.Android);
    }
}
```
Copy the following lines into CreateiOSAssetBundles and save it.
```
using System.IO;
using UnityEditor;

public class CreateiOSAssetBundles
{
    [MenuItem("Assets/Build iOSAssetBundles")]
    static void BuildAllAssetBundles()
    {
        string assetBundleDirectory = "Assets/AssetBundles";
        if (!Directory.Exists(assetBundleDirectory))
        {
            Directory.CreateDirectory(assetBundleDirectory);
        }
        BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles(assetBundleDirectory, BuildAssetBundleOptions.None, BuildTarget.iOS);
    }
}
```
