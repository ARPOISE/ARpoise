# ArpoiseDirectory

ArpoiseDirectory is a cgi-bin program written in C. It acts as a cgi filter between the Layar app and the porpoise.php poi provider.
If certain conditions are met, it duplicates the pois returned from porpoise. 
This allows to dynamically show sometimes more and sometimes less pois in Layar.

For compiling it you also need to clone the repository peterGraf/pbl.
