# ArpoiseDirectory

The ArpoiseDirectory front end is run by the ARpoise administrators of www.arpoise.com. Content creators who want to use the **ARpoise** or **AR-vos** apps to deliver their 3D content do NOT need to run this service.

ArpoiseDirectory is a cgi-bin program written in C. It acts as a cgi filter between the **ARpoise** or **AR-vos** apps and the porpoise.php POI (Point Of Interest) provider.

It can handle GPS areas for geofencing, and generates some useful web statistics.
