# ArpoiseDirectory

The ArpoiseDirectory is run by the administrators of www.arpoise.com. Content creators who want to use **ARpoise** or **AR-vos** to deliver their 3D content via the apps, do not need to run this service.

ArpoiseDirectory is a cgi-bin program written in C. It acts as a cgi filter between the **ARpoise** or **AR-vos** apps and the porpoise.php poi provider.

It can handle areas and creates some useful web statistics.
