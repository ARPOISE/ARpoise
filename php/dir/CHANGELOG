- gui.class.php
	createPOIScreen - change size of fields

	formatted
	map.setTilt(0); to prevent auto tilt when zooming in
	google.maps.Marker draggable code added

= Release 1.1 =
- Layar 5.0 support (animations)
- proper UTF-8 handling (hopefully finally fixed). UTF-8 is now properly
  enforced by the dashboard and the default database. If you manually edit XML,
  make sure your editor saves it as UTF-8.

= Release 1.0a =
- small bugfixes

= Release 1.0 =
- whatever you do, (re-)read INSTALL and/or UPGRADING. Some things have changed
- general summary of upgrade: Layar 4.0 support, better organization of files
  and some tweaks and enhancements

Details:
- added layer copying functionality to Dashboard. You can use this to migrate
  between data formats or create a copy for testing
- added Google Maps widget to Dashboard to help pinpoint POIs
- added UTF-8 encoding/decoding to XMLPOIConnector to help with diacritics
- added getLayarResponse hook to POIConnector abstract class. This allows you
  to override response defaults, i.e. change refresh interval or set layer
  actions
- added support for new request parameters:
  - requestedPoiId
  - version
  - userAgent
  - action
- added support new response parameters:
  - refreshInterval
  - refreshDistance
  - fullRefresh
  - showMessage
  - actions
  - deletedHotspots

  - hotspot.doNotIndex
  - hotspot.inFocus
  - hotspot.showSmallBiw
  - hotspot.showBiwOnClick

  - action.contentType
  - action.method
  - action.activityType
  - action.uri
  - action.params
  - action.closeBiw
  - action.showActivity
  - action.activityMessage
- added logic to always try to return requestedPoiId, even when not in range
- if requestedPoiId is set, the corresponding POI gets flagged with "inFocus:
  true"
- trim out optional response parameters to save bandwidth
- changes to log handler
- added ordering by distance to XMLPOIConnector and FlatPOIConnector
  (SQLPOIConnector already had it)
- deprecated FlatPOIConnector. FlatPOIConnector does not support the full v4.0
  API and will not be updated in the future
- new file config.php contains a PORPOISE_CONFIG_PATH definition. Change this
  constant to point to the directory of your config.xml, custom POIConnectors
  and layer data files. By default, these files now reside in the subdirectory
  "config" of the PorPOISe root directory
- added bounding boxing to POI selection in XMLPOIConnector. Need larger data
  sets to test actual performance gain
- fix in webApp oAuth handler, now supports lazy loading of user credentials
  and deferred oAuth initialization
- added caching to layer server so subsequent page requests are served from
  cache rather than calculated all over again
- added webApiPoiconnector for making authenticated API calls to 3rd party
  services for POI requests
- added web-app subclass settings to PorPOISe config

= Release 0.71 =
- added support for the "lang" parameter in the Filter class
- changed the precision of lat/lon in the default database from FLOAT to
  DOUBLE PRECISION to prevent severe rounding errors
- fixed a bug where the accuracy parameter was deemed mandatory while it is
  optional

= Release 0.7a =
- Fixed a bug in the dashboard

= Release 0.7 =
- Support for filter hooks (see Wiki for instructions)

  better

= Release 0.3 =
- Added support for XSL style sheets
- Added better UTF-8 handling for databases

= Release 0.2a =
