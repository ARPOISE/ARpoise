===PorPOISe for Layar===
Portable Point-of-Interest Server for Layar

===Administrative contact===
Jens de Smit, jens@layar.com

===Introduction===
PorPOISe is a server for Layar clients. It converts your data sets of POIs
(Points of Interest) into responses to the Layar client. Things like JSON
formatting and distance calculation are all done for you. PorPOISe supports
XML files and SQL databases as data stores.

===Getting started===
Read INSTALL for installation instructions. Once properly installed, you can
use the dashboard to create your first POIs. The interface is pretty spartan
but this will generate correct output format. Study the format if you intend to
generate your own XML files or database.

From here on you're on your own. Build a better interface for the dashboard or
expand PorPOISe to have more features if you need more.

===A note on tab-delimited files===
From version 1.0 tab-delimited files are deprecated and their use is
discouraged if you plan to use advanced Layar features. Your old files will
work but the newest layer features are not supported.

===History===
PorPOISe originated at SURFnet in 2009 as a spin-off from a small layer-
building experiment. Over 2010 functionality expanded and feature support
grew with Layar's feature support. In 2011, PorPOISe's primary author moved
from SURFnet to Layar and took the project with him.
